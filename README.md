🎲 Dice Game using JavaScript

Welcome to the Dice Game! This is a fun, beginner-friendly web project built using *HTML, **CSS, and **JavaScript*. Each time the page is refreshed, the dice images for Player 1 and Player 2 change randomly, 
and a winner is declared based on the dice numbers rolled.


🔍 Project Description

This project simulates the rolling of two dice:
- Each time the page is refreshed, a *random number between 1 and 6* is generated for each player.
- Corresponding *dice images* are displayed based on the number rolled.
- The *winner is decided* based on which player rolls the higher number.
- If both players roll the same number, it’s a *draw*!

This project is a great example of:
- Random number generation in JavaScript
- DOM manipulation using querySelector and setAttribute
- Updating content dynamically on page load
